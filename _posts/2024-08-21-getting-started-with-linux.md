If you’ve ever wanted to dip your toes into open source but
didn’t know where to start, contributing to the Linux kernel
might seem like an intimidating prospect. I get it—it’s the
core of an operating system used across the globe. But don’t
worry, you don’t need to be a coding wizard to get started.
With the right guidance, even beginners can make meaningful
contributions.

# Why Contribute to the Linux Kernel?
First off, why should you even consider contributing to the
Linux kernel? Well, for one, it’s everywhere. From your
smartphone to the cloud servers that power the internet, the
Linux kernel is at the heart of it all. By contributing,
you’re not just working on some obscure software; you’re
improving a system that impacts millions of people.

When I first started out, I felt a bit overwhelmed. But the
first time I saw my patch accepted and merged, I realized I was
art of something much bigger. Contributing isn’t just about
coding—it’s about learning, growing, and being part of a
community that’s making a real difference.

# Where to Start: Beginner-Friendly Areas
So, where do you actually begin? Here are a few areas that are
perfect for beginners:
- **Device Tree Bindings:**
    Device Tree (DT) bindings are like a blueprint that tells the 
    kernel how to interact with hardware. If you’re into hardware
    or just want to start with something relatively straightforward,
    writing or updating DT bindings is a great way to contribute.
    Plus, you’ll get a peek into how the kernel works with different devices.

- **Documentation:**
   You don’t need to dive into code right away. The Linux kernel has 
   tons of documentation, and it’s always in need of updates. Whether it’s
   fixing a typo or clarifying a confusing section, documentation work is a
   great entry point. Plus, it’s a contribution that’s highly appreciated by
   the community.

- **Bug Fixes and Code Cleanup:**
   Every project has its bugs, and the Linux kernel is no exception. Tackling
   minor bugs or cleaning up code (like removing outdated code or improving
   formatting) is another solid starting point. It’s also a good way to
   familiarize yourself with the codebase.

# The Kernel Contribution Workflow: What’s Different?
Contributing to the Linux kernel isn’t like contributing to other open-source
projects. If you’re used to the pull request (PR) system on GitHub, you’ll find
the Linux kernel workflow a bit different.

- **The Patch System**
   Instead of PRs, the Linux kernel uses a patch-based system. You’ll create
   patches using git and send them via email. Each patch should be focused 
   on a single issue—think of it as one problem, one solution.

- **[The Mailing List](https://lore.kernel.org):**
   Before you send your patch, it’s important to understand the mailing list
   culture. The Linux kernel community relies heavily on mailing lists for
   communication. Your patch will likely go through several revisions based 
   on feedback, so be prepared to engage in discussion and make improvements.

## Here’s a quick overview of the process:

* Pick a task: Start small—maybe fixing a typo or adding a missing DT binding.
* Make your change: Write and test your patch.
* Format the patch: Use git format-patch to generate the patch file.
* Send it off: Submit your patch to the mailing list with git send-email.
* Respond and revise: Engage with the feedback, make revisions, and resend if needed.

# Wrapping Up
Contributing to the Linux kernel is a journey. Sure, it’s not the easiest
open-source project to start with, but the rewards are worth it. The community
values quality, so take your time to learn the process, write good patches, and
don’t be afraid to ask questions.

Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Your first patch doesn’t have to be
groundbreaking—what matters is that you start. And who knows? In time, you might
find yourself making significant contributions to one of the most important
software projects in the world.

In the next post we will dig deeper into the Contribution workflow and how
you can create your patch and send it to the mailing list.

Happy coding!
